        As a developer with over two years of experience, ranging from
        Developer, UX/UI designer, Instructor, and Front-End Team Lead, I have
        learned that the most minor details can take an app from good to great.
        I am passionate about writing clean, performant code. In previous roles,
        I have taken apps from user stories to production and completed 85%-95%
        of the front-end team's tasks each sprint. In my current position, I
        took one year's worth of React projects, finished them within six
        months, and then cleaned out the backlog of known React bugs. I am
        excited to discuss how I can help you create incredible user experiences
        through front-end development.
